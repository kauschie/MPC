# ADE   
Amy Data Extraction program

The Location of the most recently maintained version is MPC/patch/cpp_ver/. Python has a weird issue importing the text data files from legacy windows systems with legacy text encoding but I can parse it correctly in a lower level language. There's instructions to build it for a Mac which the research technicians use during data analysis and there isn't a need for a Windows version currently. 

# MPC
Med Associates Programming for Drs Dietz and Amy Gancarz Kausch

Added repository to github so that it could be accessed and viewed remotely

Has programs relating to and requested by Dr's David Deitz and Dr. Amy Gancarz-Kausch

Started out as version control to avoid my crude naming scheme of the files (eg *_v5, *_v6, *_v7 etc.)
