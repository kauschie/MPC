Number of patch changes



Average Time in Patch
Average Water Volume Rejected by Leaving the Patch
Total Water Consumed
-First and Final Patches are not included in the above calculations



Numer of patch changes = # of changes averaged over 2 sessions
    o Count the number of -20 instances

Time in patch - mean duration stayed in receptacle before changing to the other
    o make datapoint pairs class

    o find first -20, throw out all data before hand and begin:

    o if -13 || -14 -> take time stamp
        o if -13, check for -23 and calc time
            - if stumble upon another -13 or -14  first, raise error
        o if -14, check for -24 and calc time
            - if stumble upon another -13 or -14  first, raise error
        o remember last data taken so that you can remove it at the end


    o return average time spent between them
